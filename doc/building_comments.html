<h3>Optional Build Configuration, Additional Comments, and Suggestions</h3>
<p>The following are some suggestions regarding ways things could go wrong while
building CSI, and some additional information about build options.</p>

<p>If you want to use a different C++ compiler than your default, you can
specify this by a command like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">scons CXX_ALT=/path/to/COMPILER</kbd></p>

<p>CSI should build nicely (squelching all warnings in the appropriate
places) for Clang and GCC versions 4.6+.  It is unlikely to build for
GCC versions before 4.2.</p>

<p>As noted, LLVM version 3.1 or newer is required.  If LLVM is not installed
in a standard location, you will probably have to tell scons where to find the
LLVM configuration helper for your installation.  You can do this by a command
like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">scons LLVM_CONFIG=/path/to/llvm-config</kbd></p>

<p>If you get an error like<br/>
<samp class="indent">/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lLLVM-3.X</samp><br/>
this means that your LLVM installation isnâ€™t built as a shared object.  This
will likely only happen if you built LLVM from source.  Your configure command
when building LLVM should look something like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">configure --enable-shared</kbd></p>

<p>CSI is capable of aggressive optimization for program coverage
instrumentation schemes.  Specifically, if you are hoping to use fully-optimal
instrumentation for program coverage (see the
<a href="running_optimization.html">coverage optimization</a> page), you will
need to build CSI with support for connecting to the
<a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> optimization framework.  Naturally,
you first need to have <a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> installed.
Then, you can tell CSI where to find your
<a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> installation by a command like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">scons GAMSDIR=/path/to/GAMS</kbd><br/>
Note that this path should point to the primary
<a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> installation directory, which contains
the <kbd>gams</kbd> executable, as well as a subdirectory called
<kbd>apifiles/</kbd>.</p>
