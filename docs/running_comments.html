<h1>Running CSI</h1>
<hr class="half"/>
<h3>Additional Comments and Suggestions</h3>
<p>The following are some suggestions regarding ways things could go wrong while
trying to run the CSI compiler, and some additional information about
command-line options.</p>

<p>A standard compilation of <samp>csi-cc</samp> should provide, in
addition to the source file being compiled and any other required
compilation options for that file:
<ul>
  <li>A schema indicating what type of tracing to enable for each function</li>
  <li>An optimization level for coverage-based tracing (see below for defaults, and the
    <a href="running_optimization.html">Coverage Optimization</a> page for details on flags)</li>
</ul>
For example, to gather call-site coverage for all functions using basic level 1 optimization,
the command would be<br/>
<kbd class="indent">csi-cc --trace=cc.schema -csi-opt=1 &lt;input file&gt;</kbd><br/>
while gathering call-site coverage using one of the fully-optimal instrumentors
(longer compile times,but less instrumentation required) would be<br/>
<kbd class="indent">csi-cc --trace=cc.schema -csi-opt=3 -opt-style=lemon &lt;input file&gt;</kbd><br/>

<hr class="minorsep"/>

<p>It’s fine to symlink to the <samp>csi-cc</samp> file, but you
shouldn’t copy it out.  You can move the entire CSI directory as
required, but the relative path between the <samp>Release</samp>
directory and the <samp>Tools</samp> directory (and all files inside
them) must be the same, or things won’t work.</p>

<p>If you get an error like<br/>
<samp class="indent">Error opening '/.../csi/Release/libCSI.so': libLLVM-3.X.so:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</samp><br/>
this means that the LLVM version you built with (see
<a href="building_comments.html">building notes</a> on LLVM_CONFIG)
does not match the one in your <kbd>PATH</kbd>.</p>

<hr class="minorsep"/>

<p>The full list of CSI-specific options is as follows</p>
<pre>
USAGE: csi-cc [options] &lt;inputs&gt;

COMMON OPTIONS:
  --trace=&lt;file&gt;          Use &lt;file&gt; as the input file for the tracing schemes.
                          If this option is not given, the scheme is read from
                          stdin.
  -csi-opt=&lt;arg&gt;          Use &lt;arg&gt; as the optimization level for CSI
                          instrumentation passes.  Legal values are &lt;0,1,2,3&gt;.
                          (Default: 2)
  -opt-style=&lt;arg&gt;        Use &lt;arg&gt; as the style for CSI optimization level 2 or
                          3.
                          Legal values for level 2: &lt;simple,local,local-prepass&gt;
                          (Default for level 2: local-prepass)
                          Legal values for level 3: &lt;gams,lemon&gt;
                          (Default for level 3: gams, if installed)
  --silent                Do not print pass-specific warnings during
                          instrumentation
  
  --help                  Display this help message and exit
  --help-clang            Display additional options (clang's help message) and
                          exit

OPTIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CSI:
  -debug-pass=&lt;arg>       Enable printing of extremely verbose debug messages
                          for the pass specified as &lt;arg&gt;.  This should
                          generally not be used unless debugging instrumentors.
                          &lt;arg&gt; can be any of the supported instrumentors or
                          'all' (which enables debugging for all passes).
                          Legal values are
                          &lt;all,prep,bbc,cc,fc,pt,coverage-optimization&gt;.
                          This option is only available if LLVM is built with
                          assertions enabled.
  -verify-results         Enables additional verification of computed results
                          during instrumentation.  For example, this ensures
                          that all coverage sets are verified during
                          optimization.  This is an expensive operation.
  -no-filter              Do not filter tracing schemes.  All schemes provided
                          will be used verbatim for functions to which they
                          match.
  -no-heuristics          Do not use heuristics to improve coverage optimization
                          performance.  Presently, this has little-to-no impact
                          on performance in most cases, but should generally
                          only be used for debugging instrumentors.
  -log-stats              Logs various statistics about coverage optimization
                          sets to stdout.  Presently, this is used for research
                          experiments.

LESS COMMON OPTIONS:
  --indirect-style=&lt;arg&gt;  Use the provided style for creating indirect
                          functions, which enables custimization of
                          instrumentation.  Current styles are {std, ifunc}.
                          (Default: std)
  -path-array-size &lt;arg&gt;  Use &lt;arg&gt; as the size of path tracing arrays
                          (Default: 10)
  -hash-size &lt;arg&gt;        Use &lt;arg&gt; as the maximum-size function (in number of
                          acyclic paths) to instrument for path tracing
                          (Default: ULONG_MAX/2+1)
  -complete-exe           Optimize coverage instrumentation further such that
                          accurate coverage information is only guaranteed for
                          complete function executions.  This can potentially
                          improve instrumentation efficiency, but may lose
                          information; thus, it should not be used in normal
                          circumstances.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
  PT_ARRAY_SIZE           See -path-array-size (above).  Flags have precedence.
  PT_HASH_SIZE            See -hash-size (above).  Flags have precedence.
  CSI_SILENT              Enables or disables the printing of instrumentation
                          warnings.
                          See --silent (above).  Flags have precedence.
