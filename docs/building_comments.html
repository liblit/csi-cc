<h1>Building CSI</h1>
<hr class="half"/>
<h3>Optional Build Configuration, Additional Comments, and Suggestions</h3>
<p>The following are some suggestions regarding ways things could go wrong while
building CSI, and some additional information about build options.</p>

<p>If you want to use a different C++ compiler than your default, you can
specify this by a command like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">scons CXX_ALT=/path/to/COMPILER</kbd></p>

<p>CSI should build nicely (squelching all warnings in the appropriate
places) for Clang and GCC versions 4.6+.  It is unlikely to build for
GCC versions before 4.2.</p>

<hr class="minorsep"/>

<p>As noted, LLVM version 3.1 or newer is required.  If LLVM is not installed
in a standard location, you will probably have to tell scons where to find the
LLVM configuration helper for your installation.  You can do this by a command
like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">scons LLVM_CONFIG=/path/to/llvm-config</kbd></p>

<p>If you get an error like<br/>
<samp class="indent">/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lLLVM-3.X</samp><br/>
this means that your LLVM installation isnâ€™t built as a shared object.  This
will likely only happen if you built LLVM from source.  Your configure command
when building LLVM should look something like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">configure --enable-shared</kbd></p>

<p>If you intend to use aggressive optimization (see below), you should
also consider building LLVM with assertions enabled. The flags for this will
vary with LLVM version, but, as an example, a standard build to use CSI with
LLVM 4.0 would be:<br/>
<kbd class="indent">cmake srcdir -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON
-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON -DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON</kbd></p>

<hr class="minorsep"/>

<p>CSI is capable of aggressive optimization for program coverage
instrumentation schemes.  Specifically, if you are hoping to use fully-optimal
instrumentation for program coverage (see the
<a href="running_optimization.html">coverage optimization</a> page), you will
need to build CSI with support for connecting to one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> optimization framework</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.gurobi.com">GUROBI</a> optimizer AND the
    <a href="https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon">LEMON</a> graph library</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first option, you first need to have <a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> installed.
Then, you can tell CSI where to find your
<a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> installation by a command like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">scons GAMSDIR=/path/to/GAMS</kbd><br/>
Note that this path should point to the primary
<a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> installation directory, which contains
the <kbd>gams</kbd> executable, as well as a subdirectory called
<kbd>apifiles/</kbd>.</p>

<p>For the second option, you, again, need to up-to-date installations of
<a href="https://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a> and
<a href="https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon">LEMON</a>.
Then, you can tell CSI where to find your installations by a command like<br/>
<kbd class="indent">scons LEMONDIR=/path/to/lemon GUROBIDIR=/path/to/gurobi</kbd><br/>
Again, these paths should point to the top-level directories of the installed
tools, containing subdirectories like <kbd>bin</kbd> and <kbd>include</kbd>.

<p>If building on OSX, note that many pre-packaged distributions of LLVM do not
include a full LLVM shared object for linking with CSI.  If you see linker
errors when building with pre-installed LLVM, please try building LLVM from
source.  The LLVM project provides guides for installing
<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html">LLVM</a> and
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">Clang</a> from source.</p>
